# For Benjy to do:
 - Fix WebVR/WebXR issues on this and probably dispersion-vr too
 - Integration with Structureskit.jl
 - Set things up with a portal frame
 - Hand controller interaction with the frame
 - Button to change between nothing/shear forces/bending moments
 - Implement bending moments as an axis next to each structural member, more similar to how they are normally drawn. maybe this should replace the colours?

# For Lanyi to do:
 - Decide on exactly what the testers will be doing.
 - Finish survey
 - Decide what to do about colorbars? How will users know what the colours mean? --- DONE
 - Decide what background/where the scene should be
