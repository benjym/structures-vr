# structures-vr
Structural analysis in virtual reality for education.

This app currently displays a simple beam. The user can change the supports (each end can be pinned, fixed or free), and the user can move the beam with their controllers. The bending moment or shear force diagram is overlaid on top of the beam as a colour map. The user can change between these.

## Installation
 1.  Download the repo
 2.  Run `npm install` in the source directory
